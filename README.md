Technologies Used:
  - HTML 
  - CSS : grid, DOM
  - JavaScript : Array, loop, object


Anticipated problems:
  - The word letter couldn't be the same to each other, other wise will the letter will be mass up.
      ex. if i have may, you, mom, the o and m will have two of them, will be confuse.
      
  - Two mass up with user's word shouldn't be the same as others. 

  
  - Each time user find the three word will give a new board, randon three word board from the three word array, will be hard, because there will be the same letter include in two word. 
  
  
Potential solutons:

  - But if my array have key value pair, the index and the Letter, it will solove the upper two questions.
 
  - ramdom word board prblem, could solve by sign the number and letter directly, to avoid the problem.
